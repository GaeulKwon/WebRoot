            <h1>Web Resources</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="http://htmldog.com">HTML Dog</a><br />
                    HTML Dog presents client-side technologies in a much more readable and easier to understand 
                    way for anyone that codes. This website is good for all programmers because each tutorial is 
                    divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. The beginner tutorials are step-by-step 
                    guides, intermediate and advanced tutorials “contain stand-alone tips, tricks and best-practice 
                    techniques”. I will be using this website as my skills progress as time goes and apply the skills 
                    I learned when building my own app. I find this website useful because they provide more than just 
                    tutorials. Their “Techniques” page is filled with reading materials outlining ways in which common 
                    web design features can be achieved. The “Examples" page helps the user to easily demonstrate and 
                    visualize the outcome of a specific code. And the “References” page provides references for HTML and CSS. <br />

                <li><p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Khan Academy</a><br />
                    Khan Academy provides great information about JS, HTML, CSS, SQL, and other web development tools such as 
                    how to use browser developer tools or hosting website on Github. This website would be especially useful 
                    to the beginner and intermediate learners as it covers more of the basic structure of web development. 
                    What I love about this website is that it is easy to navigate to the topics I am interested in and they 
                    have their own interactive tutorials like W3Schools. They also provide challenges throughout the lessons 
                    which I am going to use a lot to push myself to apply what I learned right away. <br />

                <li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning">LinkedIn Learning</a><br />
                    LinkedIn Learning provides various courses from experienced professionals based on my interests and skills. 
                    The educational materials are great for both beginners and intermediate learners. The website lets the users 
                    choose a particular subject, such as Android development, IOS development, Web development, and etc, they are 
                    interested in and lets users train at their own pace. The courses are taught as lecture videos and the duration 
                    of each course is usually around 1 hour to 3 hours. This website is also useful because they provide “Learning Paths” 
                    program which is compiled playlists of related video courses on a specific career track. For myself, I can use 
                    this program to learn and prepare the skills that are needed to become an efficient full-stack web developer. <br />

                <li><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a><br />
                    MDN Web Docs is a valuable online resource created by an open community of developers which is updated regularly 
                    by employees of Mozilla, Apple, Google, & Microsoft. I find this website useful because I can easily search for 
                    what I am looking for and find pragmatic explanations from credible professionals. Anyone working on the web will 
                    find this a valuable resources for web technologies and the software that powers the web including CSS, HTML, JS, 
                    Open Web app development, Firefox add-on development, and more. As this website is an evolving learning platform, 
                    I am planning to use this website to get the information I need and to contribute my knowledge when I reach that 
                    level of expertise. <br />

                <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a><br />
                    Stack Overflow is an open community to get help on coding questions, share knowledge, and find career connections 
                    for anyone who codes. I think this is one of the best sites to get technical information for programming and 
                    development because they have all kinds of incredible amount of resources from everyone around the world. However, 
                    this community website is not suitable for beginners as most experienced users expect very specific questions with 
                    lots of details. It would be most useful for intermediate, advanced learners, and experts. I can use this site as 
                    a resource to look up things and to ask questions when doing school projects and in the future, for work-related projects. <br />

                <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br />
                    W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know 
                    in order to autho good  web pages. This is value because there are a lot of tutorials 
                    and examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, Node. Anyone 
                    working on the web will find this a valuable resources for authoring web apps. I can
                    use this site as a resource to look up the things I need as well as working through 
                    tutorials to learn new things, as well as refreshing what I have forgotten. <br />
